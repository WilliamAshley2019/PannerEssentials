I would like to a some more functions to this but I hit the first benchmark I find both the pattern sync and breakpoint files sort of unique for a vst3 plugin as this plugin was based on much older audio programmming code. 

So I don't have many breakpoint files in play but its sort of like a form of internal automation. The idea here is to allow a form of "more complex" automation to be saved via a text file that may add more functions.

The idea of "automation texts" is likely dated and the ability to use python etc.. vfx scripting likely makes a lot more sense via host automation but just epxerimenting with some of these old methods.

Essentially the break point files are duration and amount. I've also allowed the GUI UI portion to be able to adjust the panning curve and it will mapt to the text. Yuo can save and load these text files.
